BY SELECTING THE "ACCEPT" OPTION AND DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, USING, OR COPYING THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST SELECT "DECLINE" AND MUST NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, USE, OR COPY THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT.

License Grant
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Accessibyte grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use one copy of the Software Product on a single computer. Use of the Software Product on multiple computers, in a multi-user environment, or on systems that allow simultaneous access requires a separate license for each user and/or computer, as further detailed in your purchase documentation.

License Terms Based on Purchase Channel
Purchase-Specific Terms:
The specific terms and duration of your licenseâ€”including the number of permitted activations, license duration, and update periodâ€”are determined by the details provided at the time of purchase. Licenses may be purchased directly from the Accessibyte website or from authorized third party sellers. Any variations from the default terms will be explicitly stated in the purchase documentation or accompanying license certificate.

Default License Restrictions and Update Terms:
Unless otherwise specified in your purchase documentation:

The default license permits a single activation on a single machine.

The Software Product is not eligible for deactivation or transfer to another machine.

The default license includes one year of updates from the date of activation. In certain cases, your license may provide for an extended update period.

After the expiration of the update period, you may continue using the Software Product; however, access to new updates, features, or performance enhancements will require the purchase of an updated license.

License Duration and Renewal:
The effective duration of your license is as specified in your purchase documentation. If no specific duration is indicated, the default term is one year from the date of activation for update eligibility. Continued use of the Software Product beyond this period without a renewed license is permitted solely for functionalities that do not require current updates. To receive new updates and features, a renewed or updated license must be purchased.

Restrictions on Transfer and Use
Transfer:
You may not assign, sublicense, or otherwise transfer your rights under this Agreement without the express written consent of Accessibyte.

Use:
You may not install or use the Software Product on more computers than permitted by your specific license. In a multi-user environment, each user must have an appropriate, valid license.

Copying:
You may not copy any part of the Software Product except as required for normal operation (e.g., creating temporary copies in memory). One archival copy may be made for backup purposes only, provided it is stored separately from the primary copy.

Restrictions on Alteration
You may not modify, decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Software Product or its accompanying documentation.

Update and Maintenance
Accessibyte Studio updates and upgrades are mandatory for the Software Product to function correctly. As described above, your license includes a specified update period during which you will receive these critical updates. Once this period expires, the Software Product may continue to be used; however, essential functionalities, improvements, or features may become unavailable. In some cases, failure to install the necessary updates may result in the Software Product operating improperly or ceasing to function entirely until an updated license is purchased to renew your update period.
